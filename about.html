              <h3 class="BangaSSi">Grading the Wheat</h3>
              <p class="mb-2 text-justify">1 : Wheat arrives at our flour mill. Samples are then taken from the wheat for chemical and physical analysis. It is graded majorly on the basis of protein content and stored in Silos for further use.</p>
              <p class="mb-2 text-justify">2 : Before grinding, it is essential to clean the wheat. Raw wheat passes through several cleansing processes before finally arriving at the separator. Strict quality checks are followed to ensure supreme quality wheat products.</p>
              <p class="mb-2 text-justify">3 : The separator machine then separates wheat grains from other impurities via a metal screen. Impurities larger than the wheat grain size are instantly removed.</p>
              <p class="mb-2 text-justify">4 : The wheat then moves on to an Aspirator. The Aspirator is like a vacuum cleaner, sucking up the impurities lighter than wheat particles efficiently.</p>
              <p class="mb-2 text-justify">5 : A Disk separator then moves the wheat over a series of disks (with indentations). This machine removes the particles that have the same size as that of the wheat particles.</p>
              <p class="mb-2 text-justify">6 : Another machine, the Spiral Seed Separator singles out the seeds of other plants. This machine exploits the fact that wheat is oval in shape, while most other seeds are round in shape. While spinning, Oval wheat moves towards the center of the cylinder, while the round seeds/particles move outwards.</p>
              <p class="mb-2 text-justify">7 : Another uncommon method VIKRAM ROLLER FLOUR MILLS employ to purify the wheat is the usage of Magnets. Powerful magnets easily remove metal particles that may have been missed in the earlier stages.</p>
              <p class="mb-2 text-justify">8 : A scourer scrapes-off dirt and hair, while a color sorting machine removes material which does not match with the color of the wheat.</p>
              <h3 class="BangaSSi mt-8">Processing The Flour</h3>
              <p style="color: #000">Quality Assurance</p>
              <p class="mb-2 text-justify">VIKRAM ROLLER FLOUR MILLS takes quality control as the top priority during the milling process. We ensure that -</p>
              <p class="mb-2 text-justify">1 : As soon as the Whole Wheat is received at the flour mill, it is tested for protein content via chemical and physical analysis.</p>
              <p class="mb-2 text-justify">2 : It is thoroughly checked for the ash content that remains after burning.</p>
              <p class="mb-2 text-justify">3 : During each stage of purification and processing, samples are taken by our quality management officers and millers to check quality consistency.</p>
              <p class="mb-2 text-justify">4 : All the milling machinery and equipment are thoroughly cleaned, disinfected and sterilized by anti-fungal and anti-bacterial agents.</p>
              <p class="mb-2 text-justify">5 : The plant machines and equipment are then treated with hot water to remove the traces of the cleaning agents.</p>
              <p class="mb-2 text-justify">6 : The final product undergoes the minerals & vitamins test, cooking test, and additives test in compliance with the government regulatory standards.VIKRAM ROLLER FLOUR MILLS monitors its manufacturing process, quality, and customer delivery very closely. Your loyalty and trust is our biggest reward.</p>

            <div class="col-md-6  pt-md-5 pl-5">
              <h3 class="BangaSSi">Preparation for Grinding</h3>
              <p class="mb-2 text-justify">1 : Purified wheat is washed with warm water before placing it in a centrifuge dryer. Any remnant impurities get removed during this stage.</p>
              <p class="mb-2 text-justify">2 : Next comes what we call 'Tempering' or 'Conditioning' of the wheat. In this step, the moisture of the wheat is controlled to allow for removal of Bran layer and efficient grinding. This usually involves the addition of moisture rather than removal.</p>
              <p class="mb-2 text-justify">3 : Wheat of different grades is blended together, depending upon the type of product to be manufactured.</p>
              <p class="mb-2 text-justify">4 : The batch is then moved into the 'Entoleter,' a trade name of a device having rapid spinning disks. It crushes the wheat grains against small metal pins. Cracked grains get removed in this process as they are unsuitable for grinding.</p>
              <p class="mb-2 text-justify">5 : The wheat batch then moves to the Breaker Rolls. These are two large metal rollers of different sizes moving at two different speeds. The spiral grooves in these breaker rolls crack open the grains of wheat and separate the interior from the outer bran layer. The cracked-wheat from Breaker rolls passes through metal sieves, and separated as -<br>
                * : Fine material (Known as Coarse Flour of Farina)<br>
                * : Larger pieces of the interior are called Semolina (Dalia)<br>
                * : The third product is Farina that is still attached to the Bran.</p>
              <p class="mb-2 text-justify">6 : Farina or Middlings are moved to the 'Middlings Purifier' and the remaining material moves to another pair of breaker rolls.</p>
              <p class="mb-2 text-justify">7 : Middlings purifier then moves places middlings over a vibration screen. Blowing air over the screen removes the lighter bran particles. Middling moves through the screen for further fine grinding.</p>
              <p class="mb-2 text-justify">8 : Middlings are ground into flour by pairs of giant metal rollers. Every time the flour is ground, it moves through the sieves to separate it into flours of different fineness.</p>
              <p class="mb-2 text-justify">9 : By sifting, separating, and regrinding the flour, different grades of it can be produced. These are then combined as per the need to produce the final product.</p>
